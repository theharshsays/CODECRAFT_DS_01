2. Country Metadata Summary (Examples):

Country Name	Country Code	Region	Income Group	Special Notes
Aruba	ABW	Latin America & Caribbean	High income	
Afghanistan	AFG	South Asia	Low income	The reporting period for national accounts data is fiscal year-based. Multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists, requiring alternative conversion factor estimates for certain periods.
Angola	AGO	Sub-Saharan Africa	Lower middle income	The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics.
Albania	ALB	Europe & Central Asia	Upper middle income	
United Arab Emirates	ARE	Middle East & North Africa	High income	
China	CHN	East Asia & Pacific	Upper middle income	Data for China do not include data for Hong Kong SAR, China; Macao SAR, China; or Taiwan, China. Alternative exchange rate estimates are used for certain periods.
United Kingdom	GBR	Europe & Central Asia	High income	
Zimbabwe	ZWE	Sub-Saharan Africa	Lower middle income	National Accounts data are reported in Zimbabwean Dollar (ZWL). Before 2017, one ZWL is set to be equal to one USD.The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists .
United States	USA	North America	High Income	
India	IND	South Asia	Lower middle income	The reporting period for national accounts data is designated as either calendar year basis (CY) or fiscal year basis (FY). For this country, it is fiscal year-based (fiscal year-end: March 31). Also, an estimate (PA.NUS.ATLS) of the exchange rate covers the same period and thus differs from the official exchange rate (CY).
